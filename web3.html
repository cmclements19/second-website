    						<h2><font color="white">Lacrosse</h2>
    						<p><font color="white">Lacrosse is Clay's most recent new found love in his life. He just started playing three years ago and felt apart of the lacrosse lifestyle from the start. He has always know he was Native American but never was able to actually get in touch with his heritage until he found lacrosse. To him, lacrosse is more than a game, it is called the "Medicine Game" in the Native communities because it is a healing game. When you play the Creator's game, it brings you one with Earth and the Creator. Which then ultimatly makes you feel at peace playing for your brothers and the Creator, but most importantly keeping the heritage alive. He hopes to always play the game until he dies and then pass on the game to his children so they can experience the Medicine Game and be one with the Creator. </p>

    						<h2><font color="white">Football</h2>
    						<p><font color="white">The sport of football was Clay's first contact sport he ever played. He grew to love it through middle school and especially loved playing tight-end and becoming the MVP of his team with the most points for the season. Once he was in highschool he stopped playing football and moved on to just watching college and pro football whenever he can. He loves watching his Green Bay Packers play and also his two favorite college teams, USC and Ohio State. Although he misses playing the sport, he is fine with just spectating because his heart is stuck on lacrosse.</p>

   						<h2><font color="white">Racing</h2>
    						<p><font color="white">Although some may say that racing is not a sport, Clay thinks it for sure is because he once raced. When he was young, his dad bought him a racing gocart and took him to tracks to practice and race for fun against friends. Athlough he did not do it for long, he loved racing when he was doing it and would love to do it again anytime he could. As he says,"There is nothing like the thrill of speed!"</p>
